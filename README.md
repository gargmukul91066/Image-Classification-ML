# Image-Classification-ML

###  Problem Statement

Plant diseases pose a significant threat to agricultural productivity worldwide. Early and accurate identification of plant diseases is crucial for minimizing crop loss and ensuring food security. Traditional methods of disease detection are often manual, time-consuming, and error-prone.

This project aims to **develop a machine learning-based image classification system** to automatically detect and classify leaf diseases in plants using histogram-based feature extraction. The objective is to train multiple models and identify the one that offers the most reliable performance, which can then be deployed in real-world agricultural monitoring applications.
